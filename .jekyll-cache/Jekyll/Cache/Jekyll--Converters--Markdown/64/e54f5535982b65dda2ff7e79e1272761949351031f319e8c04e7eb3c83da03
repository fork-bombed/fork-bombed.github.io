<p>Unpacked is a new project focusing on documenting my learning experience with reverse engineering and malware analysis. Iâ€™ve done some reverse engineering in the past, but have never delved deeper into the world of low-level programming. If youâ€™re a complete beginner or want to learn more about reversing malware, then feel free to follow my journey.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently a 2nd year university student studying for my BSc in Computer Science. I run a lot of cyber security events around campus and want to get more students involved in the fun world of information security. Unfortunately, my university doesnâ€™t have many options for cyber security until 4th year, so I have to find time to research on my own when Iâ€™m not busy with my degree. At the time of writing this, the country is in lockdown due to COVID-19, so nowâ€™s a great time to tackle this massive project.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m by no means a great writer, but this is something I hope to improve on as I write more articles. So please bear with me while I discover my style of writing :)</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to be doing some crackmes (Iâ€™ll explain what these are in my next blog post) over the next week as well as some reversing challenges on sites like HackTheBox so that I can get some basic practice in. Iâ€™ll also be researching x86 assembly and system internals so that I can have a good foundational understanding before moving onto more advanced techniques. Once Iâ€™ve got basic reversing skills down, Iâ€™m going to move onto setting up a lab for malware analysis and starting with some samples that people have already analysed so I can compare. Iâ€™ll be posting all write-ups on this blog, so make sure to follow along.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t have a schedule at the moment, but as I go along I can get a better idea of how long it takes me to write a blog post or a write-up and can make a more consistent schedule.</p>
