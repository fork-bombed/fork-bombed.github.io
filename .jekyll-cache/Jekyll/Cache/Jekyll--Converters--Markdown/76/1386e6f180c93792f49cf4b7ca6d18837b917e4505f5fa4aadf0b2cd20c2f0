<p>Unpacked is a new project focusing on documenting my learning experience with reverse engineering and malware analysis. Iâ€™ve done some reverse engineering in the past, but have never delved deeper into the world of low-level programming. If youâ€™re a complete beginner or want to learn more about reversing malware, then feel free to follow my journey.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently a 2nd year university student studying for my BSc in Computer Science. I run a lot of cyber security events around campus and want to get more students involved in the fun world of information security. Unfortunately, my university doesnâ€™t have many options for cyber security until 4th year, so I have to find time to research on my own when Iâ€™m not busy with my degree. At the time of writing this, the country is in lockdown due to COVID-19, so nowâ€™s a great time to tackle this massive project.</p>
