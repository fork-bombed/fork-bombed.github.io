Unpacked is a new project focusing on documenting my learning experience with reverse engineering and malware analysis. I've done some reverse engineering in the past, but have never delved deeper into the world of low-level programming. If you're a complete beginner or want to learn more about reversing malware, then feel free to follow my journey.

I'm currently a 2nd year university student studying for my BSc in Computer Science. I run a lot of cyber security events around campus and want to get more students involved in the fun world of information security. Unfortunately, my university doesn't have many options for cyber security until 4th year, so I have to find time to research on my own when I'm not busy with my degree. At the time of writing this, the country is in lockdown due to COVID-19, so now's a great time to tackle this massive project.
